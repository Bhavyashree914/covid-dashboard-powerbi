## üß≠ Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the **global economic and demographic impact of COVID-19** using Power BI.  
It explores relationships between **population demographics, GDP per capita, median age, and life expectancy**, highlighting how the pandemic influenced global economies and population health.

The dashboard provides **interactive visuals**, **key performance indicators (KPIs)**, and **geographical insights** to help policymakers and analysts understand COVID-19‚Äôs worldwide effects.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze the **correlation between life expectancy** and **elderly population (65+)**.
- Compare **GDP per capita**, **median age**, and **population density** across countries.
- Visualize **continent-wise disparities** in healthcare and economic indicators.
- Provide an **interactive and intuitive dashboard** for global data exploration.

## üß† Insights & Findings
- Countries with **higher median age** tend to have **better healthcare systems** and **longer life expectancy**.  
- **GDP per capita** shows a strong positive correlation with **life expectancy**.  
- **Europe** and **North America** show higher aged populations (65+) but maintain high life expectancy.  
- Developing regions in **Africa** and **Asia** show lower GDP per capita and shorter life expectancy.
